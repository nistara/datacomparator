This project aims to provide a shiny app for comparing different (dated)
versions of a given dataset. The app will allow:

* to upload separately the *old*, and *new* dataset from an `.xlsx` file

* to compare **data structures** using [`linelist::compare_data()`](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/linelist/reference/compare_data.html)

* to visualise **changes in data entries** using [`compareDF::compare_df()`](https://github.com/alexsanjoseph/compareDF)

* to identify **duplicates** in *old* and *new* data

* to visualise **changes in duplicates**

## Contributors

This project is currently only a concept. We are currently looking for
volunteers to help :)
